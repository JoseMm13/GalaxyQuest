COMPULSORY EXERCISE BLOCK 1

Analyze the following proposal:
We are going to develop a game called "Galaxy Quest". It will have both a web 
version and a mobile version to provide accessibility across multiple platforms, so 
we will need technology that supports this versatility.Players can embark on solo missions
against AI-controlled adversaries or engage in multiplayer missions with other players over the Internet.

We will require high-bandwidth web hosting to ensure smooth online gameplay 
experiences. Additionally, we will use a MySQL database to store user data and 
game progress, always adhering to data protection regulations.

In the game, players will take on the role of space explorers from various factions: 
the United Earth Federation or the Nova Pirates. Players may be registered users 
(who must log into the application) or guest users. Registered users can choose 
any faction, but guest users will only be able to choose the Nova Pirates. Each 
faction has unique spaceships with customizable features and weapons (e.g., 
photon torpedoes, plasma cannons).
At the beginning, users will select a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard), which 
will determine the game's challenge. Each spaceship is stationed at a coordinate (x, y, z) 
in a 3D space grid when the game starts. 
Players will take turns navigating their ships, exploring planets, and 
engaging in battles. When encountering adversaries, players choose which ship 
and weapon to use. Each weapon has a special ability that can be activated, 
dealing extra damage but consuming more energy.
 Weapons have a finite amount of energy that decreases with each use. When 
depleted, the weapon becomes unusable unless the player is a registered user 
who has accumulated resources from previous successful missions.
Each ship has a shield system that absorbs a certain amount of damage before 
affecting the ship's hull integrity.
If a ship avoids damage for five consecutive turns, its shields will regenerate to full 
capacity.
During each turn, players can perform actions such as moving, scanning for 
enemies, or attacking. The opposing player is notified of any damage taken.
The game continues until one faction's fleet is destroyed or the United Earth 
Federation decides to retreat (the Nova Pirates never retreat).
Upon game completion, a leaderboard of top players is updated. Winners receive 
points added to their profile, which they can exchange for upgrades or additional 
resources in future games.
